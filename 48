What is Downcasting ?

When we’re casting an object to another type in Objective-C, it’s pretty simple since there’s only one way to do it. In Swift, though, there are two ways to cast — one that’s safe and one that’s not .

as used for upcasting and type casting to bridged type
as? used for safe casting, return nil if failed
as! used to force casting, crash if failed. should only be used when we know the downcast will succeed.
