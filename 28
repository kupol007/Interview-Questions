How does CloudKit differ from Core Data?

CloudKit and Core Data are two different technologies that serve different purposes, although they can be used together in some scenarios.

Core Data is a framework provided by Apple that allows you to store and manage data in a local database on an iOS, macOS, or watchOS device. Core Data provides a variety of features for data modeling, data migration, and data persistence, and can be used to build complex data-driven applications that require a local database. Core Data can be used with a variety of data stores, including SQLite, XML, and binary files.

CloudKit, on the other hand, is a cloud-based service provided by Apple that allows you to store and manage data in the cloud, rather than on a local device. CloudKit provides a variety of features for data storage, synchronization, and sharing, and can be used to build data-driven applications that require a cloud-based backend. CloudKit provides different types of data storage, including structured and unstructured data, and allows you to store data in a private or a public database.

The main differences between CloudKit and Core Data are:

Data Storage: Core Data is primarily designed for storing and managing data locally on a device, while CloudKit is designed for storing and managing data in the cloud.
Synchronization: Core Data does not provide built-in synchronization capabilities, while CloudKit provides automatic synchronization of data across devices and users.
Platform: Core Data is available on all Apple platforms, while CloudKit is only available on iOS, macOS, and watchOS.
Cost: Core Data is included with the operating system and is free to use, while CloudKit requires a developer account and may incur costs depending on usage.
