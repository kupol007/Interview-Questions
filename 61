Explain Type Property ?

You can also define properties that belong to the type itself, not to any one instance of that type. There will only ever be one copy of these properties, no matter how many instances of that type you create. These kinds of properties are called type properties. You define type properties with the static keyword. For computed type properties for class types, you can use the class keyword instead to allow subclasses to override the superclassâ€™s implementation.
