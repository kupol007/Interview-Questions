What is Nil Coalescing & Ternary Operator ?

The ternary conditional operator is a special operator with three parts, which takes the form question ? answer1 : answer2. Itâ€™s a shortcut for evaluating one of two expressions based on whether question is true or false. If question is true, it evaluates answer1 and returns its value; otherwise, it evaluates answer2 and returns its value.

The nil-coalescing operator (a ?? b) unwraps an optional a if it contains a value, or returns a default value b if a is nil. The expression a is always of an optional type. The expression b must match the type that is stored inside a. Apple Doc.
