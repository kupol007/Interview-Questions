Explain Can we have multiple UIWindows in iOS application ?

Yes, in scenarios like covering system UIAlertViews, default keyboard or covering whole app before it is placed in background to avoid screenshot. There are 3 default window enum levels defined such as: UIWindowLevelNormal, UIWindowLevelStatusBar and UIWindowLevelAlert. Usage â€” create a new UIWindow and set its makeKeyAndVisible property.
