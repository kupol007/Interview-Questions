Can you give some examples of where singletons might be a good idea in Swift?

Singleton is an object that can be instantiated only once during the runtime of the application. Singletons are useful in situations where you want to maintain a single instance of an object that needs to be shared across the application. Here are a few examples of where singletons might be a good idea in Swift:

Network Manager: A network manager singleton can be used to manage all the network requests made by your application. It can handle all the network-related tasks, such as making requests, handling responses, and caching data.
User Defaults: A user defaults singleton can be used to manage all the user preferences and settings of your application. It can be used to store and retrieve data such as user preferences, settings, and other key-value pairs.
Audio Manager: An audio manager singleton can be used to manage all the audio playback in your application. It can handle all the audio-related tasks, such as playing, pausing, and stopping audio, as well as managing volume and other playback settings.
Location Manager: A location manager singleton can be used to manage all the location-related tasks in your application. It can handle all the location-related tasks, such as getting the user’s current location, monitoring for changes in the user’s location, and handling geofencing.
Analytics Manager: An analytics manager singleton can be used to manage all the analytics-related tasks in your application. It can handle all the analytics-related tasks, such as tracking user behavior, recording events, and sending data to a remote server.
In general, singletons can be a good idea in Swift when you need to maintain a single instance of an object that needs to be accessed from multiple parts of your application. However, it’s important to use singletons judiciously and avoid creating them unnecessarily, as they can make your code harder to test and maintain if used inappropriately.
