Define Access control ?

Access control restricts access to parts of your code from the code in other source files and modules. This feature enables you to hide the implementation details of your code, and to specify a preferred interface through which that code can be accessed and used.

In Swift 3 and swift 4, we have open, public, internal, fileprivate, and private for access control. Open access is the highest (least restrictive) access level and private access is the lowest (most restrictive) access level. Almost all entities in your code have a default access level of internal.
