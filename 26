Can you give some examples of where singletons might be a bad idea in Swift?

While singletons can be useful in some cases, they can also be a bad idea in certain situations in Swift. Here are a few examples of where singletons might not be the best solution:

Dependency Injection: Singletons can make it difficult to perform dependency injection, which is an important technique for writing testable and maintainable code. By creating a singleton, you create a global instance that can be accessed from anywhere in your application, making it difficult to swap it out with a mock object for testing purposes.
Global State: Singletons can create global state in your application, which can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of your code. Global state can lead to unexpected interactions between different parts of your application, making it difficult to track down bugs and diagnose issues.
Multithreading: Singletons can create synchronization problems in a multithreaded environment. If multiple threads attempt to access or modify a singleton at the same time, it can lead to race conditions and other synchronization issues that are difficult to diagnose and fix.
Testability: Singletons can make your code harder to test because they cannot be easily replaced with mock objects for testing purposes. When using singletons, it can be challenging to isolate the behavior of your code and write meaningful unit tests.
Coupling: Singletons can create tight coupling between different parts of your application, making it difficult to make changes or introduce new functionality. If a singleton is used throughout your codebase, any changes to the singleton can have far-reaching consequences, making it difficult to maintain and evolve your code over time.
