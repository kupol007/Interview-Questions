How do you implement concurrency in Swift?


One way to implement concurrency in Swift is by using the DispatchQueue class to perform tasks concurrently. For example, the following code creates a concurrent DispatchQueue to perform a task in the background:
let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "myConcurrentQueue", attributes: .concurrent)
concurrentQueue.async {
    // Perform task in the background
}
