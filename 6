What are tuples and why are they useful in Swift?

Tuples are a data type in Swift that allow you to group multiple values into a single compound value. They are useful when you want to return multiple values from a function, or when you want to group related values together for clarity and organization.

For example, you might use a tuple to represent a personâ€™s name and age:

let person = (name: "John", age: 25)
You can access the individual values within a tuple using dot notation and the name or index of the value you want to retrieve:

let name = person.name
let age = person.1
Tuples are also useful for pattern matching and conditional binding. For example, you can use a switch statement to match the values in a tuple and execute different code based on those values:

switch person {
     case (let name, 25):
     print("\(name) is 25 years old.").
 default:
     break
}
Overall, tuples are a convenient and flexible way to group related values together and allow you to handle multiple values as a single unit. They are especially useful when working with functions and switch statements.




What are Tuples ?
Sometimes data comes in pairs or triplets. An example of this is a pair of (x, y) coordinates on a 2D grid. Similarly, a set of coordinates on a 3D grid is comprised of an x-value, a y-value and a z-value. In Swift, you can represent such related data in a very simple way through the use of a tuple.
let coordinates: (Int, Int) = (2, 3)
