Expain Default Initializer ?

Swift provides a default initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties and does not provide at least one initializer itself. The default initializer simply creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values.

Structure types automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they do not define any of their own custom initializers. Even if it has stored properties that do not have default values.
