How do you create and use protocols in Swift?


Protocols define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that a conforming type must implement. To create a protocol in Swift, you use the protocol keyword, and specify the requirements that conforming types must implement. For example:
protocol MyProtocol {
    var myProperty: Int { get set }
    func myMethod()
}
To use a protocol, you can define a type that conforms to the protocol, and implement the required methods and properties. For example:
struct MyStruct: MyProtocol {
    var myProperty: Int
    func myMethod() {
        // Implement the method
    }
}
