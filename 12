Why is immutability important?


Immutability is important in Swift because it provides a number of benefits, including:

Predictability: Immutable objects are predictable because their state cannot change. This means that once you have created an immutable object, you can be sure that its state will remain unchanged, making it easier to reason about your code.
Thread safety: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because they cannot be modified. This means that they can be safely shared between multiple threads without the risk of race conditions or data corruption.
Improved performance: Immutable objects can be optimized by the compiler because their state cannot change. This can result in improved performance, especially in cases where the same object is used frequently in different parts of the code.
Simplicity: Immutable objects can make your code simpler because you do not need to worry about the state of an object changing unexpectedly. This makes it easier to understand and maintain your code.
Better memory management: Immutable objects do not require manual memory management, as they are automatically managed by the Swift runtime. This reduces the risk of memory leaks or other memory-related issues.
Overall, immutability provides a number of benefits in Swift, including predictability, thread safety, improved performance, simplicity, and better memory management. By using immutable objects, you can make your code more robust, maintainable, and scalable, and you can reduce the risk of bugs and other issues.
