What are one-sided ranges and when would you use them?


One-sided ranges are a type of range in Swift that represent a range of values that either starts from an initial value and extends indefinitely, or ends at a final value and starts from the minimum value of the underlying type. One-sided ranges are represented by two different range operators in Swift: ... and ..<.

The ... operator is used to define a one-sided range that includes both the initial value and the final value. For example:

for i in 1...5 {
    print(i)
}
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
The ..< operator is used to define a one-sided range that includes the initial value but excludes the final value. For example:

for i in 1..<5 {
   print(i)
}
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
You would use one-sided ranges in a variety of situations in Swift, including:

Looping through a range of values: One-sided ranges are often used in for loops to iterate over a range of values.
Subscripting arrays: One-sided ranges can be used to extract a sub-array from an existing array.
Creating slices of collections: One-sided ranges can be used to extract a slice of a collection, such as a string or a dictionary.
Defining a range of valid values: One-sided ranges can be used to define the valid range of values for a particular type or property.
In conclusion, one-sided ranges provide a convenient way to define ranges of values in Swift, and they are used in a variety of situations, including looping, subscripting arrays, creating slices of collections, and defining valid ranges of values.
