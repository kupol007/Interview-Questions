Optional Chaining ?

Optional chaining is a process for querying and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be nil. If the optional contains a value, then the property, method, or subscript call succeeds; and if the optional is nil, then it returns nil. Multiple queries can be chained together, and the entire chain fails gracefully if any link in the chain is nil.
