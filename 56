Define Properties in swift ?

Stored properties store constant and variable values as part of an instance, whereas computed properties calculate (rather than store) a value instead of storing it as a part of an instance. Computed properties are provided by classes, structures, and enumerations. Stored properties are provided only by classes and structures.
