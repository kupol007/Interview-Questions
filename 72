Define Capture list ?

If you want to capture the value of a variable at the point of the closure creation, instead of having it evaluate only when the closure executes, you can use a capture list.

Capture lists are written between square brackets right after the closure’s opening bracket (and before the closure’s arguments / return type if any)

To capture the value of a variable at the point of the closure’s creation (instead of a reference to the variable itself), you can use the [localVar = varToCapture]capture list.
