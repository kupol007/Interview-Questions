Please explain final keyword into the class ?

Preventing Overrides: You can prevent a method, property, or subscript from being overridden by marking it as final. Do this by writing the final modifier before the method, property, or subscript’s introducer keyword (such as final var, final func, final class func, and final subscript).

Any attempt to override a final method, property, or subscript in a subclass or subclass a final class are reported as a compile-time error. Methods, properties, or subscripts that you add to a class in an extension can also be marked as final within the extension’s definition.
