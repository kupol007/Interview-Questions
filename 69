Explain Automatic Initializer Inheritance?

Subclasses do not inherit their superclass initializers by default.However, superclass initializers are automatically inherited if certain conditions are met.

If we provide default values for any new properties you introduce in a subclass, the following two rules apply:

Rule 1 : If your subclass doesn’t define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.
Rule 2: If your subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers — either by inheriting them as per rule 1, or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition — then it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers.
