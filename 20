Can you explain MVC, and how it’s used on Apple’s platforms?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern commonly used in software development to separate an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. The goal of using MVC is to achieve separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain, test, and modify the application.

Here’s a brief explanation of each component:

Model: This component represents the data of the application. It defines the structure and behavior of the data, and communicates with the controller to process user actions.
View: This component is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It displays the user interface and provides the user with a way to interact with the application.
Controller: This component acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user actions from the view, communicates with the model to process the actions, and updates the view with the results.
On Apple’s platforms such as iOS, macOS, and watchOS, MVC is a commonly used design pattern. In iOS development, for example, a view is represented by a storyboard or a set of XIB files, a model is represented by a set of data objects or classes, and a controller is represented by a view controller. The view controller is responsible for managing the view hierarchy, updating the view with data from the model, and responding to user interactions by invoking methods on the model.
