What accommodations have you added to apps to make them more accessible?

The types of accommodations that can be added to make apps more accessible. Some of the most common accommodations include:

VoiceOver: VoiceOver is an iOS feature that provides spoken and Braille feedback to help people with visual impairments navigate and use the app.
Switch Control: Switch Control is an iOS feature that allows people with motor impairments to control the app using switches or other alternative input devices.
Dynamic Type: Dynamic Type is a feature that allows users to adjust the size of text in an app, making it easier to read for people with visual impairments.
High Contrast: High Contrast is a feature that makes it easier to see text and other elements on the screen by using high-contrast color combinations.
Closed Captions: Closed Captions are text representations of spoken audio, allowing people with auditory impairments to follow along with the audio content in the app.
Color Blindness Simulators: Color Blindness Simulators allow developers to see what their app would look like for people with different types of color blindness, helping them to design an app that is usable for a wider range of users.
By adding these and other accommodations to an app, developers can help make the app more accessible and usable for people with a wide range of abilities.
